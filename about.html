            <h1>Hi, I'm Riley Martin</h1>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a developer living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA</p>
            <p>I am a Linux fan, currently I use Arch Linux with KDE Plasma
                desktop environment.
            </p>
            <p>My current go-to editor/IDE is VSCodium, a 'liberated' build of
                Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. For editing in the terminal, my 
                preference is Helix, a modal editor based on the selection->action
                model. Otherwise I will use vim.
            </p>
            <p>I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C and Rust and little bits here
                and there of other languages. My favorite language is Rust; it is
                efficient (unlike Python), safe (unlike C) and very developer friendly.
            </p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I do fullstack web development, using either Nodejs or Python with Flask
                for the backend.
                I am usually use React as a frontend framework.
            </p>
            <p>I am also interested in embedded development. I mostly use C for this,
                but occasionally I use C++ as well. One technology in this field that
                particularly interests me is Rust; it is much less error-prone than 
                traditional languages like C/C++ but still has low-level capabilities
                along with higher level abstractions than C, without the bloat of C++
